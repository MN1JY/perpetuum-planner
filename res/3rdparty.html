<h1 class="title">Third-Party Licenses Used in Qt</h1>
<p>Qt includes a number of third-party libraries that are used to provide certain features. Unlike the code described in the <a href="licenses.html">code used in Qt</a> document, these libraries are supplied alongside the Qt modules.</p>
<p>Third Party Software may impose additional restrictions and it is the user's responsibility to ensure that they have met the licensing requirements of the GPL, LGPL, or Qt Commercial license and the relevant license of the Third Party Software they are using.</p>
<p>Run <tt>configure -help</tt> to see any options that may be available for controlling the use of these libraries.</p>

<h3>The Independent JPEG Group's JPEG Software (<tt>libjpeg</tt>) version 8</h3>

JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not exactly identical to the input image.</i> -- quoted from <tt>src/3rdparty/libjpeg/README</tt>.</p>
<hr /><p>This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.</p>
